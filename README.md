# Spam SMS Detection Model

## Overview

Our Spam SMS Detection model is a powerful solution built to identify and classify spam messages using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The accompanying Flask interface provides users with a seamless experience for submitting SMS entries, tracking usage, and receiving real-time classification results.

## Key Features

1. **Naive Bayes Algorithm:**
   - Leveraging probabilistic classification for accurate spam detection.

2. **Flask User Interface:**
   - A user-friendly interface for easy interaction with the model.

3. **Entry Tracking:**
   - Keep track of the number of SMS entries made by the user.

4. **Spam and Non-Spam Classification:**
   - Provide a breakdown of entries into spam and non-spam categories.

## How It Works

1. **User Submission:**
   - Users submit SMS messages through the Flask interface.

2. **Naive Bayes Analysis:**
   - The model processes the message using the Naive Bayes algorithm.

3. **Real-time Classification:**
   - Users receive instant feedback on the classification results.

4. **Entry Tracking and Summary:**
   - Track the total number of entries and provide a classification summary.
